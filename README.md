## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the Chrome browser,
using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

### Load the Extension for Chrome (Chromium)

We plan to automate this in the future, but for the time being, these are the steps you need to take to load your
extension in Chrome.

Head over to `chrome://extensions` and enable Developer Mode.

Click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to your extension's `build/chrome-mv3-dev` (or `build/chrome-mv3-prod`) directory.

To see your popup, click on the puzzle piece icon on the Chrome toolbar, and click on your extension.

**Pro-tip:** pin your extension to the Chrome toolbar for easy access by clicking the pin button.
