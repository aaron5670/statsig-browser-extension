The Statsig Experimentation Browser Extension is a powerful tool designed for managing and testing Statsig Experiments
directly within your Chromium browser. With a user-friendly interface, it provides a seamless way to search, view, and
handle your experiments without leaving your browser environment.

## Installation

### Option 1: Web Store installation (recommended)

-    [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/statsig-features-and-expe/doialjibpidkdpdneplcnmkbdojpagdd/).
-    [Firefox Addons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/statsig-experimentation/).

### Option 2: Manual build and installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `pnpm install`.
3. Build the extension with `pnpm build`.
4. In your Chrome browser, navigate to **chrome://extensions/**, enable **Developer Mode**, and click on **Load unpacked
   **.
5. Upload the **chrome-mv3-prod** folder generated in the build step.
6. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚ðŸ§ª

### Search for experiments

To use this extension, you'll need a Statsig Console API Key, which you can create in
the [Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys) under **Console API Keys**.

---

## Development

To run the development server, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For instance, if you're developing for the Chrome browser
using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

For detailed guidance, refer to our [Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/).

## Making production build

Run the following command to create a production bundle for your extension:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready bundle that can be zipped and published to the stores.

### Load the Extension for Chrome (Chromium)

While we plan to automate this process in the future, follow these steps to load your extension in Chrome:

1. Head over to `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer Mode**.

   directory.

3. To view your popup, click on the puzzle piece icon on the Chrome toolbar, and select your extension.
